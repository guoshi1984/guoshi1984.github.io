\section{Basic Concept}
\subsection{SNR}\\
SNR, the signal noise ratio is defined as the ratio of power of a signal to the power of background noise
\begin{align*}
	SNR = \frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}}
\end{align*}
{\bf SNR in decibels}\\
\begin{align*}
	P_{signal,dB} = 10 log_{10}(P_{signal})
	P_{noise,dB} = 10 log_{10}(P_{noise})
\end{align*}
SNR in dB is 
\begin{align*}
   & 10 log_{10}(\frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}}) \\
 = & 10 log_{10}(P_{signal}) - 10 log_{10}(P_{noise}) \\
 = & P_{signal, dB} - P_{noise, dB}\\
\end{align*}
We see by using the unit of dB, the ratio of the power turns into addition or subtraction.
\section{Nonlinear Effect}
Nonlinear effect means when a signal is passed into a device, the relationship between the output and input is not linear. This article aims to provide an explanation of the nonlinear process.
\subsection{Harmonics}
Suppose we have an input signal with a voltage 
\begin{align*}
	v_i(t) = V_{im} cos (\omega_i t)
\end{align*}
The output  signal can be approximated by Taylor's expansion
\begin{align*}
	v_o(t) & = a_1 V_{im} cos(\omega_i t) + a_2 V^2_{im} cos^2(\omega_i t) + a_3 V^3_{im} cos^3(\omega_i t)\\
	     & = \frac{1}{2} a_2 V^2_{im} +(a_1 V_{im} + \frac{3}{4} a_3 V^3_{im}) cos(\omega_i t) + \frac{a_2}{2} V^2_{im} cos(2\omega_i t) 
\end{align*}
All the terms with $cos(n \omega_i t) $ are nonlinear terms. Therefore, an input signal with frequency $\omega$  has output with frequency $n \omega$, and this is called nonlinear effect. All the signal component with frequency $n \omega$ are called harmonics.
\subsection{Gain compression}
In the above derivation, the amplitude of $cos w_i t$ is $a_1 V_{im} + \frac{3}{4} a_3 V^3_{im}$ is the gain to the input signal $g_m$. In most cases $a_3 < 0$, when $v_{im}$ is sufficiently small, the first term dominates so the gain is equal to $log(a_1)$. But when $v_m$ is large enough, the second term is not negligible so the gain decreases from $log(a_1)$. We define {\bf 1db compression point} as the input power when the gain is decreased by 1dB from $log(a_1)$
\subsection{Intermodulation}
Suppose we have two input signals
\begin{align*}
	V_{in}(t) = V_{1m} cos(\omega_1 t) + V_{2m} cos(\omega_2 t)
\end{align*}
The third order output power term $V^{(3)}_{out}$has two components 
\begin{align*}
	V^{(3)}_{out} = &  \frac{3}{4}a_3 V^2_{1m}V_{2m} cos(2\omega_1 + \omega_2)t \\
					& + \frac{3}{4}a_3 V^2_{1m}V_{2m} cos(2\omega_1 - \omega_2)t \\ 
					& + \frac{3}{4}a_3 V_{1m}V^2_{2m} cos(2\omega_2 + \omega_1)t \\
				    & + \frac{3}{4}a_3 V_{1m}V^2_{2m} cos(2\omega_2 - \omega_1)t \\	
\end{align*}
Since these components come from sources with two frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, we call it {\bf intermodulation}. In general, the output contain components at frequencies such as $k_1 \omega_1 + k_2 \omega_2$. The order $O$ of the intermodulation is defined as the sum of the coefficients in the frequencies
\begin{align*}
	O = \sum_i|k_i|
\end{align*}
So we call $V^{(3)}_{out}$ as {\bf third order intermodulation power} because $|k_1| + |k_2| = 3$.
if $V_{1m} = V_{2m} = V_m$
\begin{align*}
	V^{(3)}_{out} = \frac{3}{4}a_3 V^3_{m}[cos(2\omega_1 - \omega_2)t +  cos(2\omega_2 - \omega_1)t] \\
					+ \frac{3}{4}a_3 V^3_{m}[cos(2\omega_1 + \omega_2)t +  cos(2\omega_2 + \omega_1)t]
\end{align*}
We are in particular interested in the components at $2\omega_1 - \omega_2$ and $2\omega_2 - \omega_1$,
because as $\omega_1$ approaches $\omega_2$, they fall within the vicinity of the original frequency components, and may therefore interfere with the desired behavior. The intermodulation distortion({\bf IMD}) is the ratio of the output power at the combination frequency to the output power at the fundamental. For example, if $V_{1m} = V_{2m} = V_m$
\begin{align*}
	V^{(3)}_{out} = \frac{3}{4}a_3 V^3_{m}[cos(2\omega_1 - \omega_2)t +  cos(2\omega_2 - \omega_1)t] \\
					+ \frac{3}{4}a_3 V^3_{m}[cos(2\omega_1 + \omega_2)t +  cos(2\omega_2 + \omega_1)t]
\end{align*}
For combination frequency $|2\omega_1 - \omega_2|$ and the fundamental $\omega_1$, the {\bf IMD} is
\begin{align*}
	IMD = (\frac{3a_3 V_m^2}{4 a_1})^2
\end{align*}
\subsection{3rd order intercept point}
The output power at base frequency 
\begin{align*}
	P_{o1} = \frac{1}{2} (a_1 V_m)^2 \equiv = G_1 P_i \\ 
\end{align*}
The output power at intermodulation frequency 
\begin{align*}
	P_{o3} = \frac{1}{2} (\frac{3}{4}a_3 V^3_m)^2 \equiv = G_3 P^3_i \\
\end{align*}
So
\begin{align*}
	P_{o1} = 10 log G_1 + 10 log P_i\\
    P_{o3} = 30 log G_3	+ 30 log P_i\\
 \end{align*}
 So both $P_{o1}$ and $P_{o3}$ has a linear relationship with $P_i$. The above equations represent two lines, but the slope of $P_{o3}$ is 3 times of that of $P_{o1}$.
 The third-order intercept point(IP3) is defined as the intercept point of the above two lines($P_{o1}$ and $P_{o3}$). We can use the slope relation to find the intercept point.
 \begin{align*}
	\frac{IP_3 - P_{o3}}{IP_3 - P_{o1}} = 3
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
	IP_3 = \frac{1}{2} (3P_{o1} - P_{o3})
\end{align*}
